# Motivation
>*It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrentsâ€”except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets.*    

Okay probably the weather isn't just like it was in the Edward Bulwer-Lytton novel *Paul Clifford*, but it's dark and cold and I (once) again was thinking that it's time for a new security/technology centric blog. I have started blog couple of times before this, but always there was an issues with the time and motivation. Let's see what happens this time :)

# Introduction
So, 40ish old geek from Espoo, Finland. Living with my wife and two awesome doggos (Corgies ofc). I have been in IT industry something like 20+ years, and in security field more than half of that time.   

Currently working in a financial sector as an *Information security technical lead / Chief architect of Security and Privacy*.
More and detailed information about me can be found on the [About](/about) page.

# What we can expect in the future
I hope to write posts that are strongly related to information security and in particular to application security and various technical security solutions. The themes around which I will focus will be heavily concentrated on open source implementations, excluding cloud environments which are not inherently open by nature.
