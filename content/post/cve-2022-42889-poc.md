**Proof on Concept / demo app about CVE-2022-42889.**

# Introduction -  CVE-2021-42889 aka text4shell
Quote from [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42889)
> Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.

This was not nearly as bad as the infamous log4shell, although there were rumours that the Internet will be on fire (again).

Quote from Rapid7
>The vulnerability has been compared to Log4Shell since it is an open-source library-level vulnerability that is likely to impact a wide variety of software applications that use the relevant object.
However, initial analysis indicates that this is a bad comparison. The nature of the vulnerability means that unlike Log4Shell, it will be rare that an application uses the vulnerable component of Commons Text to process untrusted, potentially malicious input.


# POC application
I made a small demo application to illustrate how this vulnerability can be exploited. It can be found on [Github](https://github.com/korteke/CVE-2022-42889-POC) and [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/korteke/text4shell)
