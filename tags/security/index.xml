Security.txt -file generator i just created my first application with Golang. I am pretty sure that the code is ugly, but it works :)
What is Security.txt Quote from Securitytxt.org
â€œWhen security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.</description></item><item><title>CVE-2022-42889 PoC</title><link>https://blog.kvak.net/post/cve-2022-42889-poc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 15:17:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kvak.net/post/cve-2022-42889-poc/</guid><description>
Proof on Concept / demo app about CVE-2022-42889.
Introduction - CVE-2021-42889 aka text4shell Quote from NIST
Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is &amp;quot;${prefix:name}&amp;quot;, where &amp;quot;prefix&amp;quot; is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers.</description></item></channel></rss>
