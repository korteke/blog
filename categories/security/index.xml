Security.txt -file generator i just created my first application with Golang. I am pretty sure that the code is ugly, but it works :)
What is Security.txt Quote from Securitytxt.org
â€œWhen security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.</description></item></channel></rss>
