Motivation It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrentsâ€”except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets.
Okay probably the weather isn't just like it was in the Edward Bulwer-Lytton novel Paul Clifford, but it's dark and cold and I (once) again was thinking that it's time for a new security/technology centric blog.
