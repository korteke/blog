Security.txt -file generator i just created my first application with Golang. I am pretty sure that the code is ugly, but it works :)
What is Security.txt Quote from Securitytxt.org
“When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.</description></item><item><title>Ehlo world</title><link>https://blog.kvak.net/post/ehlo-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 22:52:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.kvak.net/post/ehlo-world/</guid><description>
Motivation It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets.
Okay probably the weather isn't just like it was in the Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Paul Clifford, but it's dark and cold and I (once) again was thinking that it's time for a new security/technology centric blog. I have started blog couple of times before this, but always there was an issues with the time and motivation.</description></item></channel></rss>
