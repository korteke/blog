I am pretty sure that the code is ugly, but it works :)\nWhat is Security.txt Quote from Securitytxt.org\n“When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.”\nSecurity.txt is based on RFC 9116 and nowadays it has been implemented by various companies. The idea is to create a file that can be distributed on a website, from a predefined address (https://xxx.test/.well-known/security.txt). The file will explain how the organisation can be notified of any security vulnerabilities found.\n1Contact: https://g.co/vulnz 2Contact: mailto:security@google.com 3Encryption: https://services.google.com/corporate/publickey.txt 4Acknowledgements: https://bughunters.google.com/ 5Policy: https://g.co/vrp 6Hiring: https://g.co/SecurityPrivacyEngJobs example of Google's security.txt (RFC non-compliant).\ngensectext -generator I just created small application which generate and optionally signs security.txt -file.

The standard format for interpolation is \u0026quot;${prefix:name}\u0026quot;, where \u0026quot;prefix\u0026quot; is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - \u0026quot;script\u0026quot; - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - \u0026quot;dns\u0026quot; - resolve dns records - \u0026quot;url\u0026quot; - load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.\nThis was not nearly as bad as the infamous log4shell, although there were rumours that the Internet will be on fire (again).\nQuote from Rapid7\nThe vulnerability has been compared to Log4Shell since it is an open-source library-level vulnerability that is likely to impact a wide variety of software applications that use the relevant object. However, initial analysis indicates that this is a bad comparison. The nature of the vulnerability means that unlike Log4Shell, it will be rare that an application uses the vulnerable component of Commons Text to process untrusted, potentially malicious input.\nPOC application I made a small demo application to illustrate how this vulnerability can be exploited. It can be found on Github and Docker hub\n","link":"https://blog.kvak.net/post/cve-2022-42889-poc/","section":"post","tags":["Security","CVE","POC","Java"],"title":"CVE-2022-42889 PoC"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.kvak.net/tags/java/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Java"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.kvak.net/tags/poc/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"POC"},{"body":"Motivation It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets.\nOkay probably the weather isn't just like it was in the Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Paul Clifford, but it's dark and cold and I (once) again was thinking that it's time for a new security/technology centric blog. I have started blog couple of times before this, but always there was an issues with the time and motivation. Let's see what happens this time :)\nIntroduction So, 40ish old geek from Espoo, Finland. Living with my wife and two awesome doggos (Corgies ofc). I have been in IT industry something like 20+ years, and in security field more than half of that time.\nCurrently working in a financial sector as an Information security technical lead / Chief architect of Security and Privacy. More and detailed information about me can be found on the About page.\nWhat we can expect in the future I hope to write posts that are strongly related to information security and in particular to application security and various technical security solutions. The themes around which I will focus will be heavily concentrated on open source implementations, excluding cloud environments which are not inherently open by nature.\nAt least initially, I will probably focus on sharing and applying threat intelligence with open source solutions. In addition to this, I plan to publish a few posts related to threat hunting in cloud environments and in different SIEM solutions.\nCY!
