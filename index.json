[{"body":"","link":"https://blog.kvak.net/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"Motivation It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrentsâ€”except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets.\nOkay probably the weather isn't just like it was in the Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Paul Clifford, but it's dark and cold and I (once) again was thinking that it's time for a new security/technology centric blog. I have started blog couple of times before this, but always there was an issues with the time and motivation. Let's see what happens this time :)\nIntroduction So, 40ish old geek from Espoo, Finland. Living with my wife and two awesome doggos (Corgies ofc). I have been in IT industry something like 20+ years, and in security field more than half of that time.\nCurrently working in a financial sector as an Information security technical lead / Chief architect of Security and Privacy. More and detailed information about me can be found on the About page.\nWhat we can expect in the future I hope to write posts that are strongly related to information security and in particular to application security and various technical security solutions. The themes around which I will focus will be heavily concentrated on open source implementations, excluding cloud environments which are not inherently open by nature.\nAt least initially, I will probably focus on sharing and applying threat intelligence with open source solutions. In addition to this, I plan to publish a few posts related to threat hunting in cloud environments and in different SIEM solutions.\nCY!
