I am pretty sure that the code is ugly, but it works :)\nWhat is Security.txt Quote from Securitytxt.org\n“When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.”\nSecurity.txt is based on RFC 9116 and nowadays it has been implemented by various companies. The idea is to create a file that can be distributed on a website, from a predefined address (https://xxx.test/.well-known/security.txt). The file will explain how the organisation can be notified of any security vulnerabilities found.\n1Contact: https://g.co/vulnz 2Contact: mailto:security@google.com 3Encryption: https://services.google.com/corporate/publickey.txt 4Acknowledgements: https://bughunters.google.com/ 5Policy: https://g.co/vrp 6Hiring: https://g.co/SecurityPrivacyEngJobs example of Google's security.txt (RFC non-compliant).\ngensectext -generator I just created small application which generate and optionally signs security.txt -file. The Go application can be found from Github.\nThis was my first \u0026quot;real\u0026quot; Go-application, and it looks like it :)\n","link":"https://blog.kvak.net/post/security.txt-file/","section":"post","tags":["Security","Go"],"title":"Security.txt -file generator"},{"body":"","link":"https://blog.kvak.net/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"Motivation It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets.\nOkay probably the weather isn't just like it was in the Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Paul Clifford, but it's dark and cold and I (once) again was thinking that it's time for a new security/technology centric blog. I have started blog couple of times before this, but always there was an issues with the time and motivation. Let's see what happens this time :)\nIntroduction So, 40ish old geek from Espoo, Finland. Living with my wife and two awesome doggos (Corgies ofc). I have been in IT industry something like 20+ years, and in security field more than half of that time.\nCurrently working in a financial sector as an Information security technical lead / Chief architect of Security and Privacy. More and detailed information about me can be found on the About page.\nWhat we can expect in the future I hope to write posts that are strongly related to information security and in particular to application security and various technical security solutions. The themes around which I will focus will be heavily concentrated on open source implementations, excluding cloud environments which are not inherently open by nature.\nAt least initially, I will probably focus on sharing and applying threat intelligence with open source solutions. In addition to this, I plan to publish a few posts related to threat hunting in cloud environments and in different SIEM solutions.\nCY!
